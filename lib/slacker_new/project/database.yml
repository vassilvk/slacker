# Database connection.

# Slacker supports odbc and tiny_tds.
# When not set, driver defaults to odbc for backward compatibility.
# The odbc driver is easier to set up on Windows, but tiny_tds is recommended
# if you intend to run slacker cross-platform.
# See https://github.com/vassilvk/slacker/wiki/Slacker-Project#odbc-vs-tds for more information.
driver: odbc

# Full instance name when using odbc; hostname or IP when using tiny_tds.
server: my_server

# Port is used by tiny_tds only. Defaults to 1433 when not set.
# Use server and port when targeting named instances with tiny_tds.
port: 1433

# The target database.
database: my_database

# Slacker supports only SQL Server authentication.
user: user_name

# Set this to false when using alternative formatters such as -fh and fj.
